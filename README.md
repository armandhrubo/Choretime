# Issue to Resolve

One of the most common issues dormitories have is the congestion of amenity usages such as, cooking and laundry. We often have to wait or miss out on our chance to do laundry or cook something because someone else occupied the slot as soon as it was vacant. ChoreTime allows you to check the current status and make appointment to use the washing machine or stove at a particular time so you can tend to your other tasks and be at ease. The app will notify you 10 mins prior to your alloted time. This app is a prototype. This will be a web version with HTML/CSS and PHP. I intend or working on Android/iOS version soon.

# TARGET GROUP

Target users are mostly dormitory inhabitants who has to share amenities.

# PURPOSE

To ease the congestion of amenity usages at dormitory with an appointment system.

# PLANNING PROCESS

I will start off writing the back-end codes, at first. On week 2, I will hopefully accomplish most of the backend tasks and have a prototype demo ready with UI. I will utilise the third week for testing and more backend work, seek and resolve any issues that  may occur. For the fourth week, I will utilise the time for finalization of the UI and submission.

The user will login to the Web app. After logging in, they will click on the tab on the top header for amenities. Then, they will choose between cooking and Laundry. Based on their selection, they will be able to see if the status of cooking or laundry is busy presently. If it's occupied, they will make an appointment for a certain time. 60 minutes allocated per appointment.
