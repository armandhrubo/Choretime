ChoreTime

One of the most common issues dormitories have is the congestion of amenity usages such as, cooking and laundry. We often have to wait or miss out on our chance to do laundry or cook something because someone else occupied the slot as soon as it was vacant. ChoreTime allows you to check the current status and make appointment to use the washing machine or stove at a particular time so you can tend to your other tasks and be at ease. The app will notify you 10 mins prior to your alloted time. This app is a prototype. This will be a web version with HTML/CSS and PHP. I intend or working on Android/iOS version soon.
